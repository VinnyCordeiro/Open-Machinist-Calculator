# Open-Machinist-Calculator
Open Machinist Calculator, an open source hardware version of the Machinist Calcâ„¢ Pro calculator by Calculated IndustriesÂ®

### FAQ
* ***Why?***

Because I'm interested in learning machining and that already-available calculator is too expensive for a hobbyist like me. So the idea is research all the formulas, code them in the calculator, and use it when needed.

* ***Why have you chosen the CERN Open Hardware Licence?***

Because as much as I love the GPL, it was created for Open Source **Software**. Open Source Hardware is an entirely different beast, with very different concerns and needs to be attended, there's even an [article](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-hardware-designs.en.html) concerning that on the GNU website. This is my first Open Source Hardware project that is in full compliance with the CERN-OHL-S v2 licence, I have others licensed with earlier versions that need to be upgraded *and* modified to be fully compliant, but that's off-topic.

### TODO
* Start the code for real instead of a place holder. That also means researching all the formulas for each function, both for metric and imperial measurements. That'll be fun. ðŸ™ƒ
* Create a separate repository for the code and license under the GPL v3, the CERN licence is just for the hardware.
* The case is by no means water/dust proof, and that can be a huge problem with metallic dust from machining. That's something that needs improvement.

### UPDATES
November 28th, 2023: Initial public release.
